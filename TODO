// GOALS

// MVP Goals
- Allow user to search recipes based on ingredient and display the matching recipes to the user

// Stretch Goals
- Once the recipe is displayed, the user can click an icon to save the recipe as a favorite. This will be added to an array that will be pushed to (localStorage). When the user refreshes the page, we will check localStorage for any saved data, parse it, and update the array with the saved drinks.
- The saved recipes are then accessed by the nav link.
